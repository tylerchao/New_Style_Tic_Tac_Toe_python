This is a new style of playing the Tic Tac Toe Game. 

Game rule:
1. There are two players: o and x. Each player has three tokens. As usual way to play, each three tokens will be placed on the board by inputing the position number 1 to 9.
   However, each have only three tokens. Once the board is fulled with three tokens of your sign, then the first position of your token will be removed when you place the another token on empty poistion.
   The sequence of the tokens always follows the order in which you place the token from the beginning.
2. The winner condition will be the same. Once there is a line with three same tokens, then the player who has that token is the winner.
